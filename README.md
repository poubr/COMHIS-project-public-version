# COMHIS-project-public-version-
A project done as part of my Digital Humanities minor at University of Helsinki.



This repistory is a public version and includes the only the code I have written (with redacted passwords); all files and data belong to the ComHis group.

The purpose of this code is to gather all the frequencies of two tokens with differing spelling ('public' and 'catholic') across two data sets - all editions, and only one editions per work, in the ECCO corpus. I work with two additional files;  a previous project done by other students which has a list of all the works in ECCO (with some additional data, requires cleaning) and a list of ID conversions done by one member of COMHIS (previous project file includes the IDs in a different format to that of ECCO). Once the six tokens are gathered, I arrange them by yearly aggregates to create two files which then can be manually examined for trends.
